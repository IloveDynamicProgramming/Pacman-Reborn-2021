[HOW TO PLAY]
Just like the original game: eat all the small pellets to pass the level. If Pac hits a ghost, you get a Strike and Pac goes back to the starting position. 3 Strikes and game over, you'll have to restart the level. There are also some POWER PELLETS at random places on the board; eat one and you will be able to eat the ghosts to score bonuses.
